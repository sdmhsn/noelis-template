                Nearly all great ideas follow a similar creative process and
                this article explains how this process works. Understanding this
                is important because creative thinking is one of the most useful
                skills you can possess. Nearly every problem you face in work
                and in life can benefit from innovative solutions, lateral
                thinking, and creative ideas. Anyone can learn to be creative by
                using these five steps. That's not to say being creative is
                easy. Uncovering your creative genius requires courage and tons
                of practice. However, this five-step approach should help
                demystify the creative process and illuminate the path to more
                innovative thinking. To explain how this process works, let me
                tell you a short story.
              </p>

              <h3>A Problem in Need of a Creative Solution</h3>
              <p>
                In the 1870s, newspapers and printers faced a very specific and
                very costly problem. Photography was a new and exciting medium
                at the time. Readers wanted to see more pictures, but nobody
                could figure out how to print images quickly and cheaply. For
                example, if a newspaper wanted to print an image in the 1870s,
                they had to commission an engraver to etch a copy of the
                photograph onto a steel plate by hand. These plates were used to
                press the image onto the page, but they often broke after just a
                few uses. This process of photoengraving, you can imagine, was
                remarkably time consuming and expensive. The man who invented a
                solution to this problem was named Frederic Eugene Ives. He went
                on to become a trailblazer in the field of photography and held
                over 70 patents by the end of his career. His story of
                creativity and innovation, which I will share now, is a useful
                case study for understanding the 5 key steps of the creative
                process.
              </p>

              <h3>A Flash of Insight</h3>
              <p>
                Ives got his start as a printer’s apprentice in Ithaca, New
                York. After two years of learning the ins and outs of the
                printing process, he began managing the photographic laboratory
                at nearby Cornell University. He spent the rest of the decade
                experimenting with new photography techniques and learning about
                cameras, printers, and optics. In 1881, Ives had a flash of
                insight regarding a better printing technique. “While operating
                my photostereotype process in Ithaca, I studied the problem of
                halftone process,” Ives said. “I went to bed one night in a
                state of brain fog over the problem, and the instant I woke in
                the morning saw before me, apparently projected on the ceiling,
                the completely worked out process and equipment in operation.”
                Ives quickly translated his vision into reality and patented his
                printing approach in 1881. He spent the remainder of the decade
                improving upon it. By 1885, he had developed a simplified
                process that delivered even better results. The Ives Process, as
                it came to be known, reduced the cost of printing images by 15x
                and remained the standard printing technique for the next 80
                years. Alright, now let's discuss what lessons we can learn from
                Ives about the creative process.

                      photograph down into a series of tiny dots. The image
                      looks like a collection of dots up close, but when viewed
                      from a normal distance the dots blend together to create a
                      picture with varying shades of gray. (Source:

              <h3>The 5 Stages of the Creative Process</h3>
              <p>
                In 1940, an advertising executive named James Webb Young
                published a short guide titled, A Technique for Producing Ideas.
                In this guide, he made a simple, but profound statement about
                generating creative ideas.
              </p>
              <p>
                According to Young, innovative ideas happen when you develop new
                combinations of old elements. In other words, creative thinking
                is not about generating something new from a blank slate, but
                rather about taking what is already present and combining those
                bits and pieces in a way that has not been done previously.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most important, the ability to generate new combinations hinges
                upon your ability to see the relationships between concepts. If
                you can form a new link between two old ideas, you have done
                something creative.
              </p>
              <p>
                Young believed this process of creative connection always
                occurred in five steps.
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Gather new material.</strong> At first, you learn.
                  During this stage you focus on 1) learning specific material
                  directly related to your task and 2) learning general material
                  by becoming fascinated with a wide range of concepts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>
                    Thoroughly work over the materials in your mind.</strong
                  >
                  During this stage, you examine what you have learned by
                  looking at the facts from different angles and experimenting
                  with fitting various ideas together.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Step away from the problem.</strong> Next, you put the
                  problem completely out of your mind and go do something else
                  that excites you and energizes you.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Let your idea return to you.</strong> At some point,
                  but only after you have stopped thinking about it, your idea
                  will come back to you with a flash of insight and renewed
                  energy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong
                    >Shape and develop your idea based on feedback.</strong
                  >
                  For any idea to succeed, you must release it out into the
                  world, submit it to criticism, and adapt it as needed.

              <h3>The Idea in Practice</h3>
              <p>
                The creative process used by Frederic Eugene Ives offers a
                perfect example of these five steps in action.
              </p>
              <p>
                First, Ives gathered new material. He spent two years working as
                a printer's apprentice and then four years running the
                photographic laboratory at Cornell University. These experiences
                gave him a lot of material to draw upon and make associations
                between photography and printing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Second, Ives began to mentally work over everything he learned.
                By 1878, Ives was spending nearly all of his time experimenting
                with new techniques. He was constantly tinkering and
                experimenting with different ways of putting ideas together.
              </p>
              <p>
                Third, Ives stepped away from the problem. In this case, he went
                to sleep for a few hours before his flash of insight. Letting
                creative challenges sit for longer periods of time can work as
                well. Regardless of how long you step away, you need to do
                something that interests you and takes your mind off of the
                problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fourth, his idea returned to him. Ives awoke with the solution
                to his problem laid out before him. (On a personal note, I often
                find creative ideas hit me just as I am lying down for sleep.
                Once I give my brain permission to stop working for the day, the
                solution appears easily.)
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, Ives continued to revise his idea for years. In fact,
                he improved so many aspects of the process he filed a second
                patent. This is a critical point and is often overlooked. It can
                be easy to fall in love with the initial version of your idea,
                but great ideas always evolve.
              </p>

              <h3>The Creative Process in Short</h3>
              <figure class="text-center my-5">
                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                  <p>
                    “An idea is a feat of association, and the height of it is a
                    good metaphor.”
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <figcaption class="blockquote-footer">Robert Frost</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>
                The creative process is the act of making new connections
                between old ideas. Thus, we can say creative thinking is the
                task of recognizing relationships between concepts. One way to
                approach creative challenges is by following the five-step
                process of 1) gathering material, 2) intensely working over the
                material in your mind, 3) stepping away from the problem, 4)
                allowing the idea to come back to you naturally, and 5) testing
                your idea in the real world and adjusting it based on feedback.
                Being creative isn't about being the first (or only) person to
                think of an idea. More often, creativity is about connecting
                ideas.
